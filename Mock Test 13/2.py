'''
You have organized a coding Hackathon.
You have collected marks scored by participants in an array and time taken for submission in another array.
Write a Python Program to determine the winner.
If two candiates have scored same marks, then whoever took the least time should be selected as winner.
Sample Input:
50,80,70,80,80,75
45,35,55,50,45,35
Sample Output:
2
